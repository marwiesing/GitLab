### GitLab Runners: Introduction and Overview

Welcome! In the previous lectures, we began exploring GitLab Runners, and now we're diving deeper into understanding their role and functionality. If you’ve been wondering:

- **What happens behind the scenes when a pipeline runs?**
- **Who actually runs your pipeline?**
- **What component performs the tasks or jobs defined in your pipeline?**

All these questions and more will be answered throughout these lectures.

### What is a GitLab Runner?

A **GitLab Runner** is a **lightweight, highly-scalable agent** that integrates with **GitLab CI/CD** to execute CI/CD jobs. While the **GitLab server** manages repositories, user interactions, and configurations, it does not directly execute the jobs defined in pipelines. Instead, this responsibility falls to the **GitLab Runner**.

When a CI/CD pipeline is triggered, the process unfolds as follows:

1. **Clone the Project**: The GitLab Runner clones the project repository.
2. **Read the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file**: It parses the pipeline's configuration file to understand the defined jobs and their steps.
3. **Execute the Jobs**: The Runner performs the tasks specified in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, such as building, testing, and deploying the application.
4. **Send Results**: Once the jobs are completed, the results (e.g., pass/fail status, logs, artifacts) are sent back to the GitLab instance.

### GitLab Server vs. GitLab Runner

It's essential to understand the division of labor between the GitLab server and the GitLab Runner:

- The **GitLab server**:
  - Acts as the orchestrator or "boss."
  - Manages repositories, user interactions, database operations, and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Ensures runners are operational and coordinates their activities.

- The **GitLab Runner**:
  - Executes the jobs defined in the pipeline.
  - Functions as an extension of the GitLab server, performing specific tasks as instructed.

Despite the Runner handling job execution, the GitLab server retains control over the process, ensuring seamless coordination and management.

### Key Features of GitLab Runner

1. **Open-Source and Written in Go**:
   - GitLab Runner is an open-source project, written in **Go language**. Its lightweight nature and scalability make it suitable for handling CI/CD tasks efficiently.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Depending on the needs of your CI/CD pipeline, you can **scale horizontally** by adding more runners to your architecture.
   - Runners can be added or removed dynamically, providing flexibility to meet varying workloads.

### Types of GitLab Runners

GitLab offers two main types of runners:

#### 1. **Shared Runners**:
   - These runners are provided by GitLab and shared across multiple projects within a GitLab instance.
   - They are managed and maintained by the GitLab team, offering a quick way to start running pipelines without additional setup.
   - **Limitations**:
     - Shared runners may have limited availability due to shared usage.
     - Performance might vary based on demand.

   **Use Case**: Suitable for quick tests or when no dedicated infrastructure is available.

#### 2. **Specific Runners**:
   - These are custom runners that you install and manage on your own infrastructure.
   - Specific runners offer greater control over the execution environment. You can configure them with custom software, security settings, or hardware resources.

   **Infrastructure Options**:
   - A server, virtual machine, or desktop.
   - Cloud platforms or on-premises data centers.

   **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios requiring more predictable performance, security, or custom configurations.

### What’s Next?

In the upcoming lectures, we’ll explore how to:

- **Interact with Runners from the GitLab UI**: Understand how to manage, configure, and monitor runners directly from the GitLab interface.
- **Install and Use a Specific Runner**: We’ll walk through the installation of a GitLab Runner on a local system and demonstrate how to run a pipeline using it.

By the end of this section, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of GitLab Runners and their role in automating CI/CD workflows.
