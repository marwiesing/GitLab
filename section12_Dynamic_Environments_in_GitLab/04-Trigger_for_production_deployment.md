### Merging Feature Branch to Main and Triggering the Main Pipeline

After the changes in the feature branch have been reviewed and approved in the feature branch deployment, the next step is to merge the feature branch into the `main` branch. Let's walk through the process and its implications step by step.

#### Reviewing the Feature Branch Before Merge

1. **Pipeline Status**:
   - The pipeline for the `feature-test` branch was completed successfully a few minutes ago.
   - Before merging, the **maintainer/approver** can access all relevant information to ensure the feature branch meets the requirements.

2. **Available Information**:
   - **Feature Deployment Link**: The dynamic environment created for the feature branch deployment provides a live preview of the application. The approver can review the deployed app to verify its functionality.
   - **Commit History**: The last commits to the feature branch are accessible, allowing the approver to review code changes.
   - **Pipeline Status**: The status of all pipeline stages for the feature branch can be checked, ensuring all tests and deployments were successful.
   - **Code Changes**: A detailed view of the code differences between the `feature-test` branch and the `main` branch is available for review.

3. **Merge Decision**:
   - If everything looks good (e.g., functionality is verified, tests have passed, code quality is acceptable), the maintainer proceeds to merge the branch into `main`.

### Triggering the Main Pipeline

Once the feature branch is merged into the `main` branch, the pipeline for `main` is triggered automatically. 

1. **Running the Main Pipeline**:
   - Open the running pipeline for the `main` branch to review its progress.
   - Note: The `deploy-feature` and `automated-test-feature` stages from the feature branch pipeline are absent in the `main` pipeline. These stages are specific to feature branches and not relevant for `main`.

2. **Deployment to Production**:
   - After successful execution of the pipeline, the application is deployed to the **production environment**. This means the live application now reflects the changes introduced in the merged feature branch.

### Fully Automated Deployment Pipeline

In the current pipeline model:
1. **Automation**:
   - Once the `test` stage is passed, the `deploy-production` job is executed automatically.
   - The pipeline automatically deploys the new application version to the live servers.

2. **Real-World Considerations**:
   - While this model is fine for a demo application, in real-world scenarios, automated deployment to production requires a high level of **maturity** in testing:
     - **Sophisticated Automated Acceptance Testing**: Ensures all critical business and technical requirements are met.
     - **Confidence in Automation**: The organization must trust its automation scripts to decide if the new version is ready for production.

### Introducing Manual Intervention for Production Deployment

To make the deployment process safer, you can add a step requiring **manual approval** for production deployment. This ensures human intervention before live changes are made.

#### Modifying the Pipeline for Manual Approval

1. **Pipeline Configuration**:
   - In the `deploy-production` job, add the `when: manual` condition to the job configuration.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     deploy-production:
       stage: deploy
       script:
         - ./deploy-to-production.sh
       only:
         - main
       when: manual
     ```

2. **Effect of `when: manual`**:
   - The `deploy-production` job will be **skipped automatically** after the `test` stage completes.
   - The pipeline will pause and wait for **manual action** to trigger the production deployment.

3. **Best Practices**:
   - While the transcript shows this change being made directly in the `main` branch for demonstration purposes, this is **not recommended** in real projects. Changes to the pipeline configuration should be made in a separate branch and thoroughly tested before being merged into `main`.

### Running the Manual Deployment Job

After modifying the pipeline:
1. **Paused Pipeline**:
   - Once the pipeline reaches the `deploy-production` stage, it pauses and waits for manual intervention.
   - The UI will display a "play" button for the `deploy-production` job.

2. **Triggering the Job**:
   - Two options are available to run the job:
     - **Stage Level**: Click the play button at the stage level to run all jobs in the stage.
     - **Job Level**: Click the play button for the specific job to run it individually.
   - Since there is only one job in this stage (`deploy-production`), both options achieve the same result.

3. **Executing the Job**:
   - Click the play button to run the job. The deployment proceeds as usual, and the new application version is deployed to the production environment.

---

### Summary

- The pipeline for `main` now includes a manual approval step for production deployment.
- This ensures that a human reviews the application for business logic, functionality, and other critical aspects before pushing it live.
- The `when: manual` keyword provides the flexibility to pause automation at key stages and require human intervention.

In the next lecture, we will explore more advanced pipeline configurations and real-world scenarios where such manual triggers can improve deployment safety and reliability.
