### Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline for building and pushing a Docker image:


### 2. **Global Variables**
   ```yaml
   variables:
     IMAGE_TAG: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/employee-image:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Specifies environment variables that are accessible to all jobs in the pipeline.
   - `CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE`: Auto-populated by GitLab, represents the container registry path for the project.
   - `CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG`: Auto-populated by GitLab, represents the current branch name, URL-safe (e.g., `feature-branch`).
   - `IMAGE_TAG`: Combines the registry path and branch name to tag the Docker image uniquely.

---

### 3. **Build Job Configuration**
#### **3.1. Image**
   ```yaml
   image: docker:latest
   ```
   - Specifies the Docker image used to run this job. It provides the environment where the job executes.
   - Here, the `docker:latest` image includes Docker CLI tools.

#### **3.2. Tags**
   ```yaml
   tags:
     - gitlab-org-docker
   ```
   - Ensures that this job runs on runners with the `gitlab-org-docker` tag, which are configured to support Docker-in-Docker (`docker:dind`).

#### **3.3. Services**
   ```yaml
   services:
     - docker:dind
   ```
   - Specifies the Docker-in-Docker service, enabling Docker commands (e.g., `docker build`, `docker push`) to execute within the pipeline.
   - A secondary container runs alongside the job, acting as a Docker daemon.

#### **3.4. `before_script`**
   ```yaml
   before_script:
     - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Prepares the environment before the main script runs.
     - `docker login`: Authenticates the Docker CLI with the container registry.
     - `CI_REGISTRY_USER` and `CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: Auto-populated variables in GitLab for authentication.

---

### 4. **Build Job Script**
   ```yaml
   script:
     - docker build -t $IMAGE_TAG .
     - docker images
     - docker push $IMAGE_TAG
   ```

   **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   1. **Build the Docker Image**:
      ```bash
      docker build -t $IMAGE_TAG .
      ```
      - `-t $IMAGE_TAG`: Tags the image with the `IMAGE_TAG` variable.
      - `.`: Specifies the build context, which is the current directory.
   
   2. **List Docker Images**:
      ```bash
      docker images
      ```
      - Lists the Docker images available locally. Useful for debugging.

   3. **Push the Docker Image**:
      ```bash
      docker push $IMAGE_TAG
      ```
      - Pushes the tagged image to the container registry (`CI_REGISTRY`).

---

### 5. **How It Works**
- GitLab Runner pulls the `docker:latest` image to create a job environment.
- The `docker:dind` service is started to enable Docker commands.
- The `before_script` logs in to the container registry using auto-populated credentials.
- The `script`:
  1. Builds a Docker image with the provided `Dockerfile`.
  2. Pushes the image to the GitLab Container Registry using the `IMAGE_TAG`.

---

### Key Notes:
- **Security**: The `CI_REGISTRY_USER` and `CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` credentials are automatically masked in logs.
- **Image Tagging**: The use of `$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG` ensures images are uniquely tagged per branch, avoiding overwrites.
- **Shared Runners**: Using `docker:dind` with shared runners requires `privileged` mode to be enabled.
