## **Introduction to GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Execution**

This guide introduces how GitLab CI/CD pipelines work, using an example `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and highlighting the importance of specifying a Docker image for job execution.

## **Logs Overview and Automatic Job Setup**

- **Logs**: Job execution logs in GitLab CI/CD are divided into sections, each representing a distinct process GitLab performs during the job.
- **Automatic Execution**:
  - If you don’t explicitly define an environment in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, GitLab will automatically provision one.
  - For example, if no Docker image is specified, GitLab might use a shared runner with a default image, which may not include your preferred environment (e.g., Python).

---

## **Key Concepts**

### **GitLab Runner**

- GitLab does not execute jobs directly; it relies on **GitLab Runner**, a lightweight and scalable agent.
- **Runner Responsibilities**:
  - Picks up CI jobs defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
  - Executes them on external machines (local or cloud-based).
  - Returns the results to the GitLab instance.
- **Shared Runners**:
  - If no specific runner is defined, GitLab uses shared runners by default.
  - These runners are preconfigured but may not have the exact environment or dependencies needed for your job.

## **.gitlab-ci.yml Example**

Below is your example `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
job-to-run-the-code:
    image: python:3.9
    script:
        - python hello.py
        - python new_test.py
```

### **What Happens During Execution**

1. **Specifying the Docker Image**:
   - The `image: python:3.9` line instructs GitLab to use the Python 3.9 Docker image.
   - This ensures the correct Python version and pre-installed tools are available for your scripts.

2. **Script Execution**:
   - The `script` section lists commands to be executed:
     - `python hello.py`: Runs a script to print or perform specific actions.
     - `python new_test.py`: Executes additional Python tests or tasks.

3. **Why Define the Image?**
   - Without specifying the image, GitLab may default to an unrelated environment (e.g., Ruby).
   - Specifying `python:3.9` guarantees:
     - The right Python version is used.
     - Dependencies for Python 3.9 are available (e.g., pip, venv).

### **Job Execution Process**

Here’s how the pipeline works step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The job begins with `gitlab-runner` starting the process.
   - If no image is defined, GitLab uses a default environment (not guaranteed to match your needs).

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - In this case, `python:3.9` Docker image is pulled and provisioned as the environment.

3. **Source Code Retrieval**:
   - GitLab fetches the repository’s source code, including `hello.py` and `new_test.py`.

4. **Script Execution**:
   - Each command in the `script` section is executed sequentially.

5. **Post-Execution Cleanup**:
   - Temporary resources (e.g., the runner, allocated memory) are cleaned up.
   - The job status (e.g., success or failure) is returned.

6. **Job Logs and Time Tracking**:
   - Logs display each step of the process, along with the time taken.
   - Retry options are available to rerun the job independently of the entire pipeline.

### **Pipeline Behavior**

1. **Automatic Triggering**:
   - Any commit in the repository triggers the pipeline automatically.
   - For example:
     - Changing `hello.py` will trigger the pipeline, ensuring the script runs successfully.

2. **Branch Management**:
   - **Feature Branches**:
     - Pipelines trigger automatically for feature branches (e.g., `dev1`).
     - Useful for testing changes before merging to production.
   - **Master Branch**:
     - Production pipelines may require manual approval before execution to prevent unintended deployments.

---

### **Retry Options and Timeout Settings**

- **Retry Button**:
  - Allows rerunning individual jobs, not the entire pipeline.
  - Useful for fixing transient issues (e.g., network problems).

- **Timeout Setting**:
  - Default timeout is 1 hour per job.
  - Prevents shared runners from being overwhelmed by long-running jobs.

- **Live Execution Demonstration**:
   - The live execution of a job was shown, emphasizing how GitLab CI/CD handles jobs step-by-step.

## **Importance of Specifying the Docker Image**

- By explicitly defining `image: python:3.9`, you control the environment:
  - **Consistency**: The job always runs with Python 3.9, regardless of runner configurations.
  - **Dependencies**: Built-in tools (e.g., `pip`) avoid the need for additional setup.
  - **Predictability**: Jobs behave the same across different environments (local, shared, or custom runners).

---

## **CI/CD Principles**

- **Pipeline Automation**:
  - Any commit to the repository automatically triggers the pipeline.
  - For large-scale applications, pipelines typically include build, test, and deploy steps.

- **Branch Strategy**:
  - Developers test in feature branches (e.g., `dev1`).
  - After testing, feature branches are merged into the master branch.
  - Master branch pipelines may have stricter controls (e.g., manual approvals).

## **Takeaways**

- **Key Concepts**:
  - GitLab Runner handles job execution.
  - Specifying `image: python:3.9` ensures consistency and reduces errors.
- **Pipeline Behavior**:
  - Automatic triggers enable CI/CD workflows.
  - Custom branch settings allow tailored execution strategies.
- **Basic CI/CD Flow**:
  - Any commit triggers the defined CI/CD pipeline.
  - The pipeline automates steps like build, test, and deploy.
