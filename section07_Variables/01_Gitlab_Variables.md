### Introduction to Variables in GitLab CI/CD

In this section, we will explore **GitLab CI/CD variables**, their purpose, how to create them, and how to use them effectively in a pipeline.

#### What Are Variables?

If you have a programming background, you are likely already familiar with variables. In general, a **variable** is a placeholder used to store information that can change depending on conditions or inputs. Variables can hold any type of information, such as strings, numbers, or even secure data.

In GitLab CI/CD, variables play a crucial role in pipelines and jobs. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Secure Data Storage**:  
   Variables are often used to store sensitive information like passwords, API tokens, or secret keys. Using variables ensures that this information is not exposed directly in the code or scripts.

2. **Reusability**:  
   Variables can hold commonly used values, such as database connection strings, API endpoints, or paths. Instead of repeating the same value in multiple places, you can define it as a variable and reference it wherever needed.

3. **Code Consistency and Maintainability**:  
   Variables help maintain consistency in your code. For example:
   - If a URL is used 100 times in your scripts and needs to be updated, you would otherwise have to search and replace the URL manually in all those places.
   - Hardcoding values in multiple locations increases the chances of missing some updates or introducing typos.
   - By defining the URL as a variable, you can update it in one place, and the change will reflect wherever the variable is used. This approach minimizes errors and ensures consistency.

#### Variables in GitLab CI/CD

In GitLab CI/CD, variables are part of the **environment** in which pipelines and jobs run. They allow you to customize and tailor pipelines based on the environment or context in which they operate. For example, you might use different variables for staging and production environments.

There are two primary categories of variables in GitLab CI/CD:

1. **Predefined Variables**:
   - GitLab provides a set of predefined variables that are automatically available in all pipelines.
   - These include metadata about the pipeline, project, and GitLab environment, such as `CI_COMMIT_SHA`, `CI_PROJECT_NAME`, and `CI_JOB_ID`.
   - These variables are read-only and cannot be modified.

2. **Custom Variables**:
   - You can define your own variables to suit specific project requirements.
   - Custom variables can be defined in several ways:
     - In the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
     - In the project settings under **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**
     - Using the GitLab API

#### Key-Value Pair Structure

Variables in GitLab are defined as **key-value pairs**, where:
- The **key** is the name of the variable.
- The **value** is the data it holds.

For example:
```yaml
variables:
  MY_TOKEN: "12345"
```
In this case, `MY_TOKEN` is the variable, and its value is `12345`.

#### Practical Uses of Variables in Pipelines

- **Secure Entities**:
  You can use variables to store credentials, API tokens, or private keys securely. These variables are accessible in your job scripts but hidden in logs, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed.

- **Environment Customization**:
  Use variables to define environment-specific configurations, such as database URLs, API endpoints, or feature toggles.

- **Reusable Constants**:
  Store constants like version numbers, file paths, or configuration options to avoid hardcoding values in scripts.

#### Ways to Define Variables in GitLab CI/CD

There are multiple ways to define custom variables, depending on your needs:

1. **In `.gitlab-ci.yml` File**:
   Define variables directly in the pipeline configuration file. These variables are accessible to all jobs in the pipeline.
   ```yaml
   variables:
     DB_USER: "admin"
     DB_PASS: "password123"
   ```

2. **In Project Settings**:
   Go to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables** in the GitLab UI. Here you can define variables that are stored securely and not exposed in the repository.

3. **Using the API**:
   GitLab's API allows you to programmatically define, update, or delete variables for a project.

4. **At Runtime**:
   You can pass variables dynamically when triggering pipelines manually or via the API. For example:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -F "token=your_pipeline_token" \
     -F "ref=main" \
     -F "variables[DEPLOY_ENV]=production" \
     "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/:id/trigger/pipeline"
   ```

#### Example

To illustrate, consider a variable for an API token:
```yaml
variables:
  API_TOKEN: "abcdef123456"
```
In a job, you can reference this variable using the `$` syntax:
```yaml
job:
  script:
    - echo "Using API Token: $API_TOKEN"
```

#### Summary

- Variables in GitLab CI/CD are key-value pairs used to store information that can change or be reused in pipelines and jobs.
- They improve security, maintainability, and customization of pipelines.
- GitLab offers predefined variables and allows you to create custom variables using multiple methods.
- Proper use of variables leads to consistent, error-free, and efficient pipeline configurations.

Next, we will demonstrate how to define and use these variables in practice.
