### Detailed Explanation of Stage and Stages in GitLab CI/CD Pipelines

#### Introduction
In this session, we explore **stages** and **stage** in GitLab CI/CD pipelines, which form the foundation for creating efficient CI/CD workflows. It's crucial to understand the distinction between the two:

1. **`stage`**: A keyword used within a job to assign it to a specific stage in the pipeline.
2. **`stages`**: A keyword used globally in the pipeline configuration to define the order of execution for stages.

These concepts work together to define how and when jobs execute in a pipeline. Let’s delve deeper into their usage with examples.

---

### Example: A Simple Pipeline Without Stages

#### Configuration:
```yaml
build-job:
  script:
    - echo "This message is from build-job"

test-job:
  script:
    - echo "This message is from test-job"

deploy-job:
  script:
    - echo "This message is from deploy-job"
```

1. **Default Behavior**:
   - If no stages are defined, GitLab automatically places all jobs under the `test` stage.
   - Jobs execute **parallelly**, regardless of their order in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

2. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - All jobs (`build-job`, `test-job`, and `deploy-job`) execute simultaneously.
   - Parallel execution is GitLab's default behavior unless explicitly overridden by defining stages.

---

### Example: Defining Stages for Ordered Execution

To control the job execution order, you need to:

1. Assign jobs to specific stages using the `stage` keyword.
2. Define the execution order of stages using the `stages` keyword.

#### Updated Configuration:
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This message is from build-job"

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This message is from test-job"

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "This message is from deploy-job"
```

1. **Stages Defined**:
   - `stages` specifies the order of execution: `build → test → deploy`.

2. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - GitLab runs the `build-job` first, followed by `test-job`, and finally `deploy-job`.
   - Jobs in each stage must complete successfully for the next stage to execute.

---

### Parallel Execution Within a Stage

When multiple jobs share the same `stage`, they execute in parallel. This is often used for running multiple tests concurrently to save time.

#### Configuration:
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This message is from build-job"

test-job-1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This message is from test-job-1"

test-job-2:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This message is from test-job-2"

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "This message is from deploy-job"
```

1. **Behavior**:
   - `test-job-1` and `test-job-2` run in parallel.
   - Both jobs must complete before the pipeline moves to the `deploy` stage.

2. **Failure Handling**:
   - If `test-job-1` fails, `test-job-2` continues executing.
   - However, the pipeline is marked as failed, and jobs in the `deploy` stage do not execute.

### Default Predefined Stages in GitLab

GitLab provides five default stages: `.pre`, `build`, `test`, `deploy`, and `.post`. These stages execute in the following fixed order:

1. **.pre**: Always the first stage.
2. **build**
3. **test**
4. **deploy**
5. **.post**: Always the last stage.

If you use these default stage names in your pipeline, you don’t need to define the `stages` keyword explicitly—GitLab automatically follows this order.

#### Example:
```yaml
.pre-job:
  stage: .pre
  script:
    - echo "This is the pre stage"

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This is the build stage"

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is the test stage"

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "This is the deploy stage"

.post-job:
  stage: .post
  script:
    - echo "This is the post stage"
```

1. **Execution**:
   - `.pre-job` executes first, followed by `build-job`, `test-job`, `deploy-job`, and finally `.post-job`.
   - The order of `.pre` and `.post` is fixed and cannot be overridden.

---

### Customizing Execution Order

If you want to override the default execution order, explicitly define the `stages` keyword.

#### Example:
```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This message is from build-job"

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This message is from test-job"

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "This message is from deploy-job"
```

1. **Behavior**:
   - The pipeline now executes `test-job` first, followed by `build-job` and `deploy-job`.
   - `.pre` and `.post` stages remain fixed as the first and last stages, respectively.

---

### Error Handling with Undefined Stages

If a job references a `stage` that isn’t listed in `stages`, GitLab throws an error.

#### Example:
```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test job"
```

1. **Error**:
   - Since `test` isn’t included in the `stages` list, the pipeline fails during configuration.
   - Ensure all custom stages are explicitly listed under the `stages` keyword.

---

### Summary
1. **Stages and Stage**:
   - Use `stage` to assign a job to a specific stage.
   - Use `stages` to define the order of execution for stages.

2. **Default Behavior**:
   - Jobs without a defined stage are automatically placed in the `test` stage.
   - Jobs in the same stage execute in parallel.

3. **Predefined Stages**:
   - GitLab provides `.pre`, `build`, `test`, `deploy`, and `.post` stages with a fixed order.
   - Explicitly overriding their order is not allowed.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Use meaningful stage names relevant to the jobs they perform.
   - Define all custom stages explicitly to avoid configuration errors.
   - Run jobs in parallel within a stage to optimize pipeline execution time. 

This comprehensive understanding ensures you can design efficient and maintainable pipelines in GitLab CI/CD.
