### **Overview**
This lecture introduces **environments and deployments** in GitLab CI/CD, focusing on aligning the project with the new workflow by:
1. Creating **static environments** (e.g., staging and production).
2. Progressing to **dynamic environments** in subsequent steps.

---

### **Key Concepts: Environments and Deployments**
1. **Definition:**
   - **Environments:** Describe where the code is deployed (e.g., staging or production).
   - **Deployments:** Occur each time a version of code is deployed to an environment.

2. **GitLab CI/CD Integration:**
   - Environments and deployments are managed within GitLab.
   - Define environments directly in the `gitlab-ci.yml` file as tags for jobs to specify deployment targets.
   - Each environment can have one or more deployments, with full deployment history maintained in GitLab.

3. **Types of Environments:**
   - **Static Environments:** Have fixed names like `staging` or `production`.
   - **Dynamic Environments:** Have dynamic names, used for temporary or branch-specific deployments (covered later).

4. **Benefits:**
   - Track current and historical deployments for every environment.
   - Know which application version is running on which environment at any time.

5. **Creating Environments:**
   - Two methods:
     1. Define directly in GitLab’s UI.
     2. Define in the project’s `gitlab-ci.yml` file (preferred method for CI/CD).

### **Next Steps**
The lecture transitions into an example:
- Practical implementation of environments and deployments using the project code from the previous section.
- Starting with **static environments**, progressing to **dynamic environments** in later videos.

This sets the foundation for understanding and implementing environments in GitLab CI/CD as part of the new optimized workflow.
